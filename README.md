## Complexity
### Attraos-patch: Based on the original Attraos model, the dynamic structure is characterized by Patches.
### Attraos-kernel: The linear ODE of the original Attraos model is written in the form of linear convolution, and the time domain convolution is equal to the frequency domain product.
